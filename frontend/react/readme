1) During development use (while in react folder):
npm run dev
1.1) This will auto rebuild if a change was made to a component. This will build a file called 'react_bundle_dev.js'
into the frontend/web/js/react folder. Do not push this file to git (it should be in .gitignore already).

2) When pushing code (while in react folder):
npm run prod
2.1) This will build the production bundle file called 'react_bundle.js' into the frontend/web/js/react folder. This
is the file you need to push.

i) Since dev and prod builds into different .js files, it is important to include the correct one depending on the
environment. Look at frontend/views/site/games.php for an example.

i) You can find these commands in 'package.json' if you want to learn what the actually do.
